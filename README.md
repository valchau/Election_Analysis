# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit:

### Why are we doing this?
This project helps Tom, who works for the Colorado elections board with a summary of the results for a U.S. congressional precinct in Colorado. The results summarize the total number of votes cast in each county, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote, including the county with the most votes cast. 
### Why use Python when we have data formated for Excel
This task is usually done in Excel, but Tom's manager wants to know if there's a way to automate the process using Python. If this audit is done successfully with Python, the code you and Tom write will be used to audit not only other congressional districts, but also senatorial districts and local elections.

### What types of votes are being counted?
There are three primary voting methods that you and Tom will take into account, mail-in ballots, punch cards, and direct recording electronic, or DRE, counting machines. Mail-in ballots are typically hand counted at the central office. Punch cards are collected and then fed into a machine that tabulates vote totals and sends the results to the central office. Finally, memory cards from DRE counting machines are sent to the central office and read by a computer. Tom's manager, Seth, would like him to become familiar with the command line, so we are providing a Python script that will both produce a text file that Tom can electronically provide to his manager as well as results on the terminal (command line).

### what do the total votes and winners tell us?
Altogether, the votes cast by these three methods will determine the final election results. After the votes are counted, your job is to generate a vote count report to certify this U.S. congressional race.

## Election-Audit Summary
In Conclusion, I ran both the original stock analysis program and the new refactored program for both 2018 and 2017 to see if my refactored code ran faster. I noticed that yes, the refactoring did help. 
Here are the results for 2018 for the original program and then the refactored program:
